Hello! 
Iam an Architectural student and seek help n order to transform information on social medial (especially instagram)
trends, likes, hashtags and follows into a performative model that will represent these changing volumes of likes through architectural 
 model. All of that should be based on Arduino if possible.
I would appreciate any help.
